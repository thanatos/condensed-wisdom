    With monotonous regularity, apparently competent men have laid down the law
    about what is technically possible or impossible — and have been proved
    utterly wrong, sometimes while the ink was scarcely dry from their pens. On
    careful analysis, it appears that these debacles fall into two classes,
    which I will call “failures of nerve” and “failures of imagination.”

—Sir Arthur C. Clarke
