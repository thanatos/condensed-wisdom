In `Programming As Theory Building`_, Peter Naur argues that the primary
activing in software engineering is the building of theory around which the
program operates. He further argues that this theory is *inseverable* from the
programmer: it *cannot* be documented! He then discusses the consequences of
such a view, and the rammifications of it on software engineering.
