On Agile

    But I was suddenly seized by a horrible thought: what if this new-found
    agility was used, not teleologically to approach the right outcome over the
    course of a project, but simply to enshrine the right of middle management
    to change their minds, to provide a methodological license for arbitrary
    management? At least under a Waterfall regime they had to apologise when
    they departed from the plan. With Agile they are allowed, in principle, to
    make as many changes of direction as they like. But what if Agile was used
    merely as a license to justify keeping the team in the office night after
    night in a never-ending saga of rapidly accumulating requirements and
    dizzying changes of direction? And what if the talk of developer ‘agility’
    was just a way of softening up developers for a life of methodologically
    sanctioned pliability?
